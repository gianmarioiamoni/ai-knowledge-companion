# Introduction to Cell Biology and Genetics

## Chapter 1: The Cell - Basic Unit of Life

### 1.1 Cell Theory

The Cell Theory is one of the fundamental principles of biology, established in the mid-19th century:

1. **All living organisms are composed of one or more cells**
2. **The cell is the basic unit of structure and organization in organisms**
3. **All cells arise from pre-existing cells**

This theory unified biology and provided a framework for understanding life itself.

### 1.2 Prokaryotic vs. Eukaryotic Cells

**Prokaryotic Cells**:
- No nucleus (DNA is in nucleoid region)
- No membrane-bound organelles
- Smaller (1-10 μm)
- Examples: Bacteria, Archaea

**Eukaryotic Cells**:
- Membrane-bound nucleus
- Complex organelles
- Larger (10-100 μm)
- Examples: Animals, plants, fungi, protists

### 1.3 Cell Organelles

**Nucleus**: Contains genetic material (DNA), controls cell activities

**Mitochondria**: "Powerhouse of the cell" - produces ATP through cellular respiration
- Equation: C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂ → 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + ATP

**Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)**:
- Rough ER: Has ribosomes, synthesizes proteins
- Smooth ER: Lipid synthesis, detoxification

**Golgi Apparatus**: Modifies, packages, and distributes proteins and lipids

**Ribosomes**: Protein synthesis (found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes)

**Lysosomes**: Contain digestive enzymes, break down waste materials

**Chloroplasts** (plant cells only): Site of photosynthesis
- Equation: 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + light energy → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂

**Cell Membrane**: Phospholipid bilayer, controls what enters/exits the cell

## Chapter 2: DNA Structure and Function

### 2.1 The Structure of DNA

DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid) is the molecule that carries genetic information.

**Components**:
- **Sugar**: Deoxyribose (5-carbon sugar)
- **Phosphate group**: Connects sugars to form backbone
- **Nitrogenous bases**: Four types
  - Purines: Adenine (A), Guanine (G)
  - Pyrimidines: Cytosine (C), Thymine (T)

**Watson-Crick Model** (1953):
- Double helix structure
- Two antiparallel strands
- Base pairing rules: A pairs with T, G pairs with C
- Hydrogen bonds between bases (A-T: 2 bonds, G-C: 3 bonds)

### 2.2 DNA Replication

DNA replication is semi-conservative - each new double helix contains one original strand and one new strand.

**Process**:
1. **Helicase** unwinds the double helix
2. **Primase** adds RNA primer
3. **DNA polymerase** adds nucleotides to form new strand
4. **Leading strand**: Synthesized continuously (5' to 3')
5. **Lagging strand**: Synthesized in Okazaki fragments
6. **Ligase** joins Okazaki fragments

**Accuracy**: DNA polymerase has proofreading ability, error rate is 1 in 10 billion nucleotides

### 2.3 From DNA to Protein

**Central Dogma of Molecular Biology**:
DNA → RNA → Protein

**Transcription** (DNA → RNA):
1. RNA polymerase binds to promoter region
2. DNA unwinds, template strand is read 3' to 5'
3. RNA synthesized 5' to 3'
4. mRNA produced (in eukaryotes, introns are spliced out)

**RNA differences from DNA**:
- Sugar: Ribose (not deoxyribose)
- Single-stranded
- Uracil (U) instead of Thymine (T)

**Translation** (RNA → Protein):
1. mRNA travels to ribosome
2. tRNA brings amino acids
3. Ribosome reads mRNA in codons (3 nucleotides)
4. Each codon specifies one amino acid
5. Start codon: AUG (Methionine)
6. Stop codons: UAA, UAG, UGA

**The Genetic Code**:
- 64 possible codons (4³)
- 20 amino acids
- Redundant: Multiple codons can code for same amino acid
- Universal: Same in nearly all organisms

## Chapter 3: Mendelian Genetics

### 3.1 Gregor Mendel's Experiments

Gregor Mendel (1822-1884) studied pea plants and discovered the fundamental laws of inheritance.

**Key Characteristics Studied**:
- Seed shape (round vs. wrinkled)
- Seed color (yellow vs. green)
- Flower color (purple vs. white)
- Plant height (tall vs. short)

**Why Pea Plants?**
- Short generation time
- Easy to cross-pollinate
- Clear, discrete traits
- Self-fertilizing (can control breeding)

### 3.2 Mendel's Laws

**Law of Segregation**:
- Each parent has two alleles for each gene
- These alleles separate during gamete formation
- Each gamete receives only one allele
- During fertilization, offspring receive one allele from each parent

**Law of Independent Assortment**:
- Genes for different traits are inherited independently
- The inheritance of one trait doesn't affect the inheritance of another
- (Note: This applies to genes on different chromosomes or far apart on the same chromosome)

### 3.3 Dominant and Recessive Traits

**Definitions**:
- **Dominant allele**: Expressed when present (represented by capital letter, e.g., T)
- **Recessive allele**: Only expressed when two copies are present (lowercase, e.g., t)
- **Homozygous**: Two identical alleles (TT or tt)
- **Heterozygous**: Two different alleles (Tt)
- **Genotype**: Genetic makeup (e.g., Tt)
- **Phenotype**: Physical appearance (e.g., tall)

**Example: Pea Plant Height**
- T = tall (dominant)
- t = short (recessive)

Possible genotypes:
- TT: Homozygous dominant (tall)
- Tt: Heterozygous (tall)
- tt: Homozygous recessive (short)

### 3.4 Punnett Squares

A Punnett square predicts the probability of offspring genotypes.

**Monohybrid Cross** (Tt × Tt):
```
     T    t
  +----+----+
T | TT | Tt |
  +----+----+
t | Tt | tt |
  +----+----+
```

Results:
- 1 TT : 2 Tt : 1 tt (genotypic ratio)
- 3 tall : 1 short (phenotypic ratio)

**Dihybrid Cross** (TtYy × TtYy):
- T = tall, t = short
- Y = yellow seeds, y = green seeds

Result: 9:3:3:1 ratio
- 9 tall yellow
- 3 tall green
- 3 short yellow
- 1 short green

## Chapter 4: Modern Genetics

### 4.1 Beyond Simple Dominance

**Incomplete Dominance**: Heterozygote shows intermediate phenotype
- Example: Red flowers (RR) × White flowers (WW) = Pink flowers (RW)

**Codominance**: Both alleles fully expressed
- Example: ABO blood groups (A and B are codominant)

**Multiple Alleles**: More than two alleles for a gene in population
- Example: ABO blood types (Iᴬ, Iᴮ, i alleles)

**Polygenic Inheritance**: Multiple genes influence one trait
- Examples: Height, skin color, eye color

### 4.2 Sex-Linked Inheritance

**Sex Chromosomes**:
- Humans: 23 pairs of chromosomes
- 22 pairs of autosomes + 1 pair of sex chromosomes
- Female: XX
- Male: XY

**X-linked Traits**:
- Genes located on X chromosome
- More common in males (only one X)
- Examples: Color blindness, hemophilia

**Example: Color Blindness**
- Xᴺ = normal vision (dominant)
- Xᶜ = color blind (recessive)

Genotypes:
- XᴺXᴺ: Female, normal vision
- XᴺXᶜ: Female, carrier (normal vision)
- XᶜXᶜ: Female, color blind
- XᴺY: Male, normal vision
- XᶜY: Male, color blind

### 4.3 Mutations

**Types of Mutations**:

**Point Mutations**: Single nucleotide change
- Silent: No change in amino acid
- Missense: Different amino acid
- Nonsense: Creates stop codon

**Frameshift Mutations**: Insertion or deletion of nucleotides
- Shifts reading frame
- Usually more severe than point mutations

**Chromosomal Mutations**:
- Deletion: Loss of chromosome segment
- Duplication: Extra copy of segment
- Inversion: Segment reversed
- Translocation: Segment moved to different chromosome

**Causes**:
- Errors during DNA replication
- Exposure to mutagens (radiation, chemicals)
- Spontaneous changes

**Effects**:
- Harmful: Sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis
- Beneficial: Lactose tolerance in adults
- Neutral: No significant effect

### 4.4 Genetic Engineering

**Recombinant DNA Technology**:
- Restriction enzymes: Cut DNA at specific sequences
- DNA ligase: Joins DNA fragments
- Plasmids: Circular DNA used as vectors

**Applications**:
- Insulin production in bacteria
- Disease-resistant crops
- Gene therapy

**CRISPR-Cas9**:
- Precise gene editing tool
- Can add, remove, or alter DNA
- Revolutionary for research and potential treatments

## Chapter 5: Evolution and Natural Selection

### 5.1 Darwin's Theory

**Key Observations**:
1. Variation exists in populations
2. More offspring are produced than can survive
3. Resources are limited
4. Individuals compete for resources

**Natural Selection**:
- Individuals with advantageous traits survive and reproduce more
- These traits become more common over generations
- Evolution is the change in allele frequencies over time

**Evidence for Evolution**:
- Fossil record
- Comparative anatomy (homologous structures)
- Comparative embryology
- Molecular biology (DNA/protein similarities)
- Biogeography

### 5.2 Mechanisms of Evolution

**Mutation**: Source of new genetic variation

**Gene Flow**: Movement of alleles between populations

**Genetic Drift**: Random changes in allele frequencies
- Bottleneck effect: Population size drastically reduced
- Founder effect: New population from small group

**Natural Selection**: Non-random, directional change
- Stabilizing: Favors average
- Directional: Shifts toward one extreme
- Disruptive: Favors both extremes

**Sexual Selection**: Traits that increase mating success
